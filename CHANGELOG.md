# dbt_lever v0.8.0

[PR #25](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/pull/25) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Change for dbt Core < 1.9.6

> *Note: This is not relevant to Fivetran Quickstart users.*

Migrated `freshness` from a top-level source property to a source `config` in alignment with [recent updates](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/11506) from dbt Core ([Lever Source v0.8.0](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever_source/releases/tag/v0.8.0)). This will resolve the following deprecation warning that users running dbt >= 1.9.6 may have received:

```
[WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
Found `freshness` as a top-level property of `lever` in file
`models/src_lever.yml`. The `freshness` top-level property should be moved
into the `config` of `lever`.
```

**IMPORTANT:** Users running dbt Core < 1.9.6 will not be able to utilize freshness tests in this release or any subsequent releases, as older versions of dbt will not recognize freshness as a source `config` and therefore not run the tests.

If you are using dbt Core < 1.9.6 and want to continue running Lever freshness tests, please elect **one** of the following options:
  1. (Recommended) Upgrade to dbt Core >= 1.9.6
  2. Do not upgrade your installed version of the `lever` package. Pin your dependency on v0.7.0 in your `packages.yml` file.
  3. Utilize a dbt [override](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/overrides) to overwrite the package's `lever` source and apply freshness via the previous release top-level property route. This will require you to copy and paste the entirety of the previous release `src_lever.yml` file and add an `overrides: lever_source` property.

## Documentation
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/pull/24))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/pull/24))

## Under the Hood
- Updates to ensure integration tests use latest version of dbt.

# dbt_lever v0.7.0
[PR #21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/pull/21) includes the following updates:
## Features
- For Fivetran Lever connectors created on or after July 27, 2024, the `USER` and `INTERVIEWER_USER` source tables have been renamed to `USERS` and `INTERVIEW_USER`, respectively. This package now prioritizes the `USERS` and `INTERVIEW_USER` tables if available, falling back to `USER` and `INTERVIEWER_USER` if not.
  - If you have both tables in your schema and would like to specify this package to leverage the `USER` and/or `INTERVIEWER_USER` tables, you can set the variables `lever__using_users` and/or `lever__using_interview_user` to false in your `dbt_project.yml`.
  - For more information, refer to the [July 2024 connector release notes](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/lever/changelog#july2024) and the related [README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/blob/main/README.md##leveraging-legacy-connector-table-names).
- Introduced the ability to union source data from multiple Lever connectors. For more details, see the related [README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors).
- Streamlined testing by removing tests from intermediate models and consolidating them in the end models, optimizing resource usage and prioritizing the final outputs.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue where the dbt package would error due to a missing `CONTACT_LINK` source table for users without source data, even though it was enabled in the Fivetran Connector. A null-filled table will now be generated in such cases.

## Documentation updates
- Add missing field definitions to dbt docs.

## Under the hood
- In the source package, updated temporary models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro.
- Added the `source_relation` column in each staging model to identify the origin of each field, utilizing the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
- Updated tests to include the new `source_relation` column.
- Included the `source_relation` column in all joins and window function partition clauses in the transform package.
- Added consistency tests for end models.
- Turned off freshness tests for the `USER`/`USERS` and `INTERVIEW_USER`/`INTERVIEWER_USER` sources to avoid possible conflicts.

- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

# dbt_lever v0.4.0
## ðŸŽ‰ Documentation and Feature Updates
- Updated README documentation updates for easier navigation and setup of the dbt package. ([#13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/pull/13))
- Included `lever_[source_table_name]_identifier` variable within the Lever source package for additional flexibility within the package when source tables are named differently. ([#13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/pull/13))
# dbt_lever v0.3.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_lever_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_lever_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_lever v0.1.0 -> v0.2.0
Refer to the relevant release notes on the Github repository for specific details for the previous releases. Thank you!
